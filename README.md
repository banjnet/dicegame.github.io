I built this by following instructions and video tutorials
To play the game, you need to click on "roll dice" and click on "hold" so that your score on the dice get stored or added to your prevous total score, 
Then it's the turn of the next player to play the game by also clicking on "roll dice" and "hold".
The first player to get to the number 20 or above, wins the game.
